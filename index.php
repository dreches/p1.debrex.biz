Over the course of over a decade, I have taken several courses at Harvard Extension school, including CSCIE12 last semester. Over the summer
my CSS/Javascript skills have managed to get rusty, and I hope to refresh them in this class. 
I had already taken a few courses on XML, including Web Development using XML and Developing e-Business applications using XML and Java.
I was a TA for the latter class as well, (in 2002), along with then graduate student David Malan, who now teaches at Harvard.

I worked till recently at MEDITECH, for 13 years, in their interface/integration group. There is definitely a lot of room for improvement
when it comes to Hospital Information Systems. Our fragmented healthcare system, and fundamental distrust of consolidating patient data by any
one group, and recently passed heavy handed patient privacy regulations have definitely slowed down the delivery of modern and effective software
and data analysis to our healthcare delivery system. For example, just verifying that you are dealing with one and the same patient in two different systems is
a challenge, because we do not have a universal patient id. But some of that is changing.
